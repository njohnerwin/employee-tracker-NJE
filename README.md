# Employee Tracker

A simple CLI designed to help you manage your employees. This was designed as an assignment for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp, and is not intended for commercial use. There's definitely better options out there, anyway! This assignment was just meant to be good practice for SQL database management, so the program itself is pretty clunky and ugly. I wouldn't recommend it.
